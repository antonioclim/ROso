Usage:
  locks_audit.sh [PATH]

Purpose:
  Demonstration for Week 8:
  - identifies processes holding a file or directory open (I/O resource),
    a situation that in practice can lead to "operational blockages" (e.g., cannot unmount).

Examples:
  ./locks_audit.sh /var/log
  ./locks_audit.sh /home/user/project

Note:
  Requires `lsof` (usually the lsof package) or `fuser` (psmisc).

Didactic observations:
- In classic deadlock (Coffman), we talk about allocated and awaited resources.
- In practice, the "resource" can also be an open file, a socket, a file lock, a mountpoint.
- Observability tools (`lsof`, `fuser`) are essential for debugging.
